Oil two large baking sheets, a bench scraper, and kitchen shears or a sharp knife. Lay a piece of parchment paper or a Silpat on the counter where the canes can dry. Move one of the baking sheets to the warm oven. \\n \\nMeanwhile, in a straight-sided deep saucepan off heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, water, cream of tartar, and salt and stir them together well. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pot and move it onto medium-high heat. Without stirring, let the syrup come up to 305 degrees. Using a pastry brush or a paint brush dedicated to culinary use, wash down any stray sugar crystals from the side of the pot. Ready the peppermint oil, food coloring, measuring spoons, and vegetable oil. Glove thyself with either heat-retardant gloves or snug mittens covered with disposable gloves. \\n \\nOnce the syrup has reached temperature, pour it out onto the room temperature baking sheet. Drizzle the peppermint oil on top, and using the bench scraper, scrape the hot candy up from the bottom and fold it over onto itself to stir it through. Once it has cooled slightly, mix in the vanilla as well. Note that the peppermint scent in the air will be strong. \\n \\nContinuously scrape up and stir the syrup to cool it until it becomes a pliable dough. Cut the dough in half and move one piece to the baking sheet inside the warm oven. (First, we\u2019ll \u201cpull\u201d the white half of the candy cane. Then we\u2019ll color the red half.) \\n \\nQuickly oil your gloved hands, as it\u2019s now time to pull the candy. Scrape up the candy dough into one piece and, working as quickly and as continuously as you can, pull it out into a rope, double it over onto itself, and twist it together. Pull it, double it, and twist it again. Keep on going this way at a quick clip, and you\u2019ll notice that the candy will start to take on a ribbon-y sheen. This is how the candy will turn white, so keep going until the color is pure. Embrace the upper body workout. Note that anytime the candy becomes too stiff, simply warm it up again in the oven to soften. \\n \\nDon\u2019t let the candy get too hard. When it\u2019s reached a nice white color, place it onto its baking sheet and move it to the warm oven. Re-oil your bench scraper. Take out the second tray of candy dough and pour on the red food coloring -- about a third of one of those tiny bottles for a good rich color. Use your scraper fold the candy onto itself to incorporate the color completely. Note that this side of the candy cane does not need to be pulled. Move both candy cane trays to the oven and let them warm through for about 5 minutes until pliant. \\n \\nOnce warm and squishy enough to work with, take both pieces of candy from the oven and roll them into logs as long as the baking sheet. Cut each log into four equal pieces. Hang on to one red piece and one white piece, moving the rest of the candy back into the oven to keep warm. \\n \\nOn the countertop, line the red and white logs alongside one another and begin to twist from one end, stretching as you go, making the candy canes as thin or as thick as you like. Use your oiled shears or knife to cut the length of each cane. Shape the hook of the cane, and press down on the ends to taper. Set the canes aside to cool. (Know, of course, that you could also cut into sticks, rounds, or individual peppermint sucking candy). Admire the individual quality of your handiwork. \\n \\nRepeat this process with the remaining 3/4 of the candy, one piece of each color at a time. \\n \\nAllow candy to cool until completely hard; about 15 minutes.

Ladle the cauliflower mornay sauce over the top of the noodles, making sure to cover the noodles completely with the sauce, and sprinkle with more of the romano cheese. Put the lasagna pan on a baking sheet, cover with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until bubbly and the top is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes longer. Remove from the oven, sprinkle the top with parsley, and let rest 15 minutes before serving.

Pour in some oil and tilt the pan to spread it around. Take a small wad of paper towel and rub it around the pan to soak up any excess oil. Put the oil soaked wad on a small plate next to the stove. \\n \\n3. Use cooking chopsticks or a fork to draw a little of the egg mixture along the bottom of the pan. If the egg cooks immediately, the pan is hot enough and ready to go. If the egg browns too fast, cool the pan down by putting the bottom of the pan on a moistened kitchen towel, and lower the heat a little. \\n \\n4. Pour a thin layer of the egg mixture into the hot pan. Tilt the pan to spread it around the bottom. Pierce any large bubbles that form with the chopsticks or fork. \\n \\n5. As soon as the egg starts to set, start rolling it to one side of the pan. Flip one end over with the chopsticks or fork and keep flipping until you have a skinny roll. If you can\'t roll the egg, you can just push it along to one side until you have a skinny little omelette. \\n \\n6. Leaving the first roll at one side of the pan, rub the oil-soaked wad of paper towel firmly along the bottom of the pan. This adds just enough lubrication while also cleaning up any stray bits of egg. \\n \\n7. Add a little more of the egg mixture to the pan, tilting the pan around to spread it. Life the first roll up a little so that the uncooked egg runs beneath it. \\n \\n8. Puncture any large air bubbles that form, as before.

As before, if the egg is browning too fast, place the pan on a moistened towel for a few seconds. \\n \\n9. Repeat the preceding three steps until the egg mixture is all used up. The thinner the layers, the more delicately textured the tamagoyaki will be. Try to do a minimum of 4-5 layers. \\n \\n10. When the tamagoyaki is done, turn seam-side down into the pan and press briefly to seal it. Flip the egg out onto a sushi mat or paper towel. \\n \\n11.

On each piece of salami, place a dollop of cream cheese, a green bean, and a stick or two of carrot. Roll into a little burrito. (If necessary, cut a toothpick in half and use it to pin the salami closed.) \\n \\n4. If you have leftover carrots or green beans, dice them for sprinkling over the rice. \\n \\n---- \\n \\nFor Rice: \\n \\n1. Pack rice into bento box and sprinkle with the excess vegetables. \\n \\n---- \\n \\nFor Garlic Sauteed Spinach: \\n \\n1. Heat the oil in a pan over medium-high heat.
